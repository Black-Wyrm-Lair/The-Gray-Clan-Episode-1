The only thing changed is a copy of ITEM.TRA named ITEM-ee.TRA. This file should be adopted to use EE engine item description formatting that differs from the one in the vanilla engine. Before you start the work please check the BG:EE or BG2:EE TLK files to see how the descriptions are formatted in your language.
