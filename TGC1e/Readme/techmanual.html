<p class="tdark1">THE GREY CLAN EPISODE ONE: IN CANDLELIGHT<br />
  <em>Technical Manual</em> &#8211; BGT-WeiDU/EET/BG:EE Edition, v1.9</p>
<p id="req" class="tdark0"> Requirements, Levels of Compatibility</p>
<p>The installation package of this mod is WeiDU-based. (In common parlance: &quot;This 
  is a WeiDU mod.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>1. A working installation of <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/mods/bgt-weidu/" target="_blank">BGT-WeiDU</a>
  or Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition or Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET). 
  You don't have to start a new game <strong>if</strong> <a href="readme.html#inote" target="_blank">certain 
  conditions</a> are met. <a href="readme.html#inote" target="_blank">Please read 
  this.</a><br />
  2. The availability of all, directly or indirectly required original game resources 
  is assumed.<br />
  3. The basic functionality of all, directly or indirectly required game resources 
  is assumed as unmodified.</p>
<p> Notes to requirements:<br />
  2. The game installation does not have to be unmodified, but removed or renamed 
  resources that are normally present in the original game may cause incorrect 
  mod behaviour and errors. (Example: this edition of the mod does not work with 
  original Baldur's Gate/TotSC or BG1Tutu/EasyTutu, and may not work with any 
  total or partial game conversions.)<br />
  3. The game installation does not have to be unmodified, but the basic functionality 
  of resources is required. (Example: replaced original travel regions that lead 
  to different areas than in the original game may cause incorrect mod behaviour 
  and errors.)</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility on technical level: </strong></p>
<p>This mod is compatible with all other standard WeiDU-based mods if 
  they meet the above requirements.<br />
  A valid filename prefix is used for all installed resource files of this mod. 
  The prefix is registered in the Community Filenames Prefix Reservations database.<br />
  This mod installs new resources. <br />
  This mod does not overwrite any existing game resources.<br />
  This mod affects (modifies or extends) existing game resources on data (content) 
  level.</p>
<p>When this mod is uninstalled, all changes except TLK entries are safely 
  removed except where cached and/or saved by the game or player. Note: the remaining 
  TLK entries are unused, therefore they won't have any practical effect on the 
  game.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility on game level: </strong></p>
<p>This mod partically affects existing game resources on data (content) level, 
  and therefore (direct or indirect) object-level interaction is possible in the 
  game with mods that affect the same resources. See the list of <a href="#resaffc">resources 
  affected on data level</a> to see which resource attributes are <em>modified</em> 
  and <em>extended</em> by this mod.</p>
<p>A valid prefix is used for all variables of this mod. The prefix is registered 
  in the Community Filenames Prefix Reservations database.</p>
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="#cpl">levels of coupling</a>.</p>

  <li> File level: <br />
    No (original game or third-party mod) files are overwritten or deleted.<br />
    Original game files are required. <br />
    No third-party mod files are required or used optionally.</li>
  <li>Data level: <br />

  <li>Variable level:<br />
    Values of (original game or third-party mod) variables are not modified.<br />
    Values of (original game or third-party mod) variables are not read and used. 
  </li>
  <li>Object level:<br />
    No (original game or third party mod) actors or items are checked and used 
    by the scripts of this mod.<br />
    Original game area(s) are referenced and used by the script(s) of this mod: 
    AR6700 is unavailable from a certain point of the plot of this mod until the 
    end of the plot of this mod. Changes made by the original game or by third-party 
    mods on AR6700 are not blocked, delayed or affected in any other way.<br />
    No third-party mod areas are referenced and used by the scripts of this mod.<br />
    Except what specified above, no other (original game or third party mod) objects 
    are checked or used by the scripts of this mod. <br />
    Known interactions: 
    <ul>
      <li>Certain (unique or common) actors of this mod may attack any game actors 
        of class (class.ids) INNOCENT, FLAMING_FIST and FIGHTER. Areas with high 
        risk: AR7600, AR7200. No other risky areas are known for this risk. </li>
      <li>Certain (unique or common) actors of this mod may attack any game actors 
        of EA (ea.ids) ENEMY, except if class (class.ids) is INNOCENT or FLAMING_FIST. 
        Areas with high risk: AR7600, AR7300, AR7200, AR7263, AR7264. No other 
        risky areas are known for this risk. </li>
    </ul>
    Since this mod affects (modifies or extends) existing game resources on data 
    level, direct or indirect object-level interaction is possible in the game 
    with mods that affect the same resources in certain ways.</li>
  <li>Time and event level:<br />
    The plot of this mod is controlled by nothing else than the logical order 
    of events triggered by (player or other in-game) actions. No timers are used.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong><br />
  The coupling between the original game and this mod is considered to be: LOOSE.<br />
  The coupling between the original game and other mods is assumed to be: NEGLIGIBLE.
