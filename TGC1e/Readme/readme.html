<p class="tdark1">THE GREY CLAN EPISODE ONE: IN CANDLELIGHT<br />
  BGT-WeiDU/EET/BG:EE Edition, v1.9</p>
<p class="tdark0">Summary of Features</p>
<ul>
  <li>This is the <strong>BGT-WeiDU/EET/BG:EE
    edition.</strong></li>
  <li>Two installation choices: Normal Edition and Lite 
    Edition. The latter one has slightly easier battles.</li>
  <li>Estimated game time: <strong>1.5-2.5 hours.</strong></li>
  <li>WeiDU-based installer: compatibility with other usual WeiDU-based mods. 
    In common parlance, this is a &quot;WeiDU mod&quot;. If you're a modder, you 
    can check the <a href="techmanual.html">Technical Manual.</a></li>
  <li><strong>First episode</strong> 
    of a trilogy: the story is an aspect of the Grey Clan's world.</li>
  <li><strong>Solid expansion</strong>: 
    no miscellaneous, non-cohesive modifications and additions on your game.</li>
  <li><strong>You don't have to start 
    a new game</strong>, you can install this mod at any point of the game. (<a href="#inote">Warning</a>.)</li>
  <li>Brand-new quests: one main quest, 
    with several subquests.</li>
  <li><strong>Difficult battles</strong>: 
    some battles are extremely challenging.</li>
  <li>New items: magical weapons and 
    armour.</li>
  <li>Enemies: bandits, undead, golems, 
    sorcerers, wizards... one of them with a brand-new soundset.</li>
  <li>Attacking mod-critical characters 
    will <strong>interrupt the mod's plot.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="tdark0">Installation and Uninstallation</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong> Installation</strong>: 
    Extract and copy the contents of tgc1e_bgt_eet_bgee.zip into your game folder. 
    Run Setup-TGC1E.exe, now found in your game folder. (If 
    it says it's &quot;auto-updating&quot; and/or closes quickly, run it again.) 
    Make sure Baldur's Gate is not running meanwhile. After you choose your language, 
    you will be offered two options: Normal Edition and Lite Edition. The battles 
    of the Lite Edition are a bit easier, in exchange you get slightly less XP. 
    After you've pressed the index of your choice, the installation will begin. 
    It should end with the message &quot;SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED [...]&quot;. Press 
    Enter to quit the setup (some files of the documentation will be opened), 
    and run Baldur's Gate. The mod's plot starts when you talk to <em>General 
    Jedyan</em>. He can be found near the Tower of Ramazith, in the city of Baldur's 
    Gate.</li>
  <li><strong>Reinstallation: </strong>Run 
    Setup-TGC1E.exe (located in your game folder) and choose the Reinstall 
    option.</li>
  <li><strong>Uninstallation</strong>: 
    Run Setup-TGC1E.exe (located in your game folder) and choose the Uninstall 
    option.</li>
</ul>
<p id="hints" class="tdark0">Hints</p>
<p>In Candlelight can be very difficult to starter players. Some hints:</p>
<div> 
  <div> 
    <ul>
      <li>The mod's plot will start when you talk to <em>General Jedyan</em>. 
        He can be found near the Tower of Ramazith, in the city of Baldur's Gate.</li>
      <li>This is Episode One, so the story doesn't entirely end when you finish 
        the mod. If you are not sure if the battle/dialogue/etc. you just finished 
        is meant to be the end of the mod, check your journal. The latest journal 
        entry will make it obvious.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to the content 
        of dialogues and journal entries.</li>
      <li>Examine the corpse of every enemy. Even the most unsignificant bandit 
        might have carried something useful or important.</li>
      <li>Use the abilities of your Thief and/or invisibility potions to explore 
        the unknown parts of hostile areas.</li>
      <li>Don't attack Flaming Fist members, it will interrupt the plot.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that the members 
        of the Flaming Fist will assist you in any battle, so if the enemy is 
        too powerful, try to lure it to the Fist's forces if they are present 
        in the area. Beyond the members of the Fist, other neutral creatures might 
        also help you.</li>
      <li>The major battles can be extremely difficult, but each of them has one 
        or more solutions. Check the message console of the game to notice the 
        powers, resistances, weak sides etc. of your enemies. Use potions, wands, 
        spells, dispel magic, ranged weapons... use a good tactic. If any of their 
        members are nearby, and your enemies are in their sight, Flaming Fist 
        will also assist you.</li>
      <li>If you have ANY problem related to this mod, and these hints and the 
        readme don't help, please don't hesitate to visit the <a href="http://forums.blackwyrmlair.net/index.php?showforum=85">mod's 
        discussion forum</a> and tell what your problem is. Other players will 
        surely join the discussion, and your problem will be sorted out.</li>

<p id="inote" class="tdark0">Important Note</p>
<p> If you have visited <a href="http://greyclan.blackwyrmlair.net/ep1/maps/map3.jpg" >the 
  district where Entar Silvershield lives</a> (AR7200) in the city of Baldur's 
  Gate <strong>before</strong> installing Grey Clan Episode I, you must load and 
  use an earlier savegame where you haven't visited it yet (or you can start a 
  new game). Otherwise, the plot of the mod will be broken. (Grey Clan Ep1 can 
  do nothing to solve this problem. It's game-specific.) </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: If you haven't visited that area yet or if you have started a new 
  game, you won't have any problem.</p>
<p class="tdark0">Troubleshooting and Updates</p>
